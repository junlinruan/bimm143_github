This is a simple nano text editor that will be available on every unix machine - that is why I am showing it to you.

pwd: print working dir (where am I basically)
cd: change directory (move around the file system)
ls: list out files and dirs
mkdir: make a new fir (a.k.a. "folder")
rm: remove files and folders (i.e. delete)
nano: a basic text editor

head: show the top lines of a file
tail: show the bottom lines of a file
cp: copy files or dirs
mx: move or rename a file or dir
